## Architectural Thoughts

Before I define the Pre requisites , I want to brief the architecture which I kept in my mind before preparing it. 
As per my expecrience I followed 

```
MicroService Architecture

```
Where I kept focus on 

```
PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT , TEAM COLLABORATION , PAIR PROGRAMMING

```

The architecture described in a way where each layer does have their own responsbility. Please see through below.


```
CONTROLLER LAYER [RESPONSIBLE FOR UI/UX INTERACTION] <---> SERVICE LAYER [RESPONSIBLE FOR BUSINESS LOGIC , AND PASS THROUGH DATA TO DAO LAYER] <--> REPOSITORY LAYER [RESPONSIBLE FOR DATA BASE OPERATIONS]

```
### ASSUMPTIONS

	*Submit a participant request: Create Player Information
	
	*Get a list of all participants: List of all the player existing in DB
	
	*Group randomly participants into (n) groups: I have used the following formula to simulate the Groups
	
	```
	No of Matches Per round is been considered as No of Groups
	No of Rounds = if (n == ODD NO) then n else n-1 where n=No of Participants
	No of Total Matches= n*(n-1)/2 where n= No of Participants
	No of Matches Per Round= no Of Total Matches/ No of Rounds
	
	*Get the list of all automatically created first-round matches: Exposed an API by which User may get Matches based on Round No

	*Update match-winner and results: The user may update the match-winner with results on the endpoint
	*Close round: Either Auto-close if all the matches are done or the user may do it manually
	*Submit a request for the new match (players and time): User may create a league by selecting players as well as time [as per understanding Start Date, Please confirm ?]this will automatically create a group of matches
	*Submit league champion: Participant ID corresponding to created League Id

### Prerequisites

For using application , seek below softwares to be available in system

```
JAVA [>=1.8]
MAVEN 3
H2
Eclipse [for code walkthrough]

```

## Test Coverage

the testcases would run whenever build is been created and could be visulaize via JACOCO plugin at 

```
../target/site/jacoco/index.html

```
